# jankiestRidesApp

Jankiest Rides
  The Jankiest Vehicle listing site.
  https://jankiestridesapp-production.up.railway.app/


Technologies Used

  -JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.JS, Mongoose, Express, and EJS.
  
 
Approach Taken

  -Followed the idea of the wireframe, but slightly different approach to the structure. Created a cars listing site where people can add, edit, view and delete listings. Also added second model to create reviews on the site. 


Unsolved problems

  -My create listing works on local host and worked, on the site, when I was deploying with instructors. I believe that I might need async and await for it to work properly on the site.


User Stories

  -As a buyer, I would like photos of the cars with information about the cars so that I can decide to purchase the vehicle quickly.

  -As a seller, I want to be able to make listings easy and quick so that I can quickly sell my car.

  -As a viewer, I would like to see all the important information about the vehicles on the main page, so that I know how much it will cost for the vehicles that I want to work for.
